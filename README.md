# Formal Verification of Computer Programs

This project explores the use of formal verification
methods using the [Dafny programming language](https://dafny.org/) and
the creation of formally verified programs -- from
simple examples to complex algorithms.

## Installation and Usage

- Install the [VS Code extension for Dafny](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dafny-lang.ide-vscode) (recommended)
- Open a Dafny file and you will be prompted to install latest version of Dafny. Click Accept.
- The Dafny VS Code integration will allow you to see the results of verification while you are writing it.
- If you want to compile, use the Dafny: Build and Run commands.

Most of the time, you won't be required to compile the code.
You only need to see the verification results.
